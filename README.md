**Project Title**

**LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) Topic Modeling Playground**  


##
**Description**


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook Binder that can be used as a tutorial to learn about how to conduct and evaluate LDA topic modeling, as well as to interpret and present the results. Some helpful readings to gain a deeper understanding of topic modeling are presented below. These can help you increase your general knowledge of topic modeling and learn different topic modeling approaches.

**Helpful Readings**

**Understanding Topic Modeling**:



* [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf)
* [Reading Tea Leaves: How Humans Interpret Topic Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3700-reading-tea-leaves-how-humans-interpret-topic-models.pdf)

**Other topic modeling approaches:**



* [LDA2vec: Word Embeddings in Topic Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/lda2vec-word-embeddings-in-topic-models-4ee3fc4b2843)
* [Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/10/stepwise-guide-topic-modeling-latent-semantic-analysis/)
* [Non-negative matrix factorization](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/nmf.html))
* [Structural Topic Modeling](https://cbail.github.io/SICSS_Topic_Modeling.html#structural-topic-modeling)

**How to Use the Binder Notebook**

To use this Topic Modeling Playground Binder Notebook, click on the [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder) icon below in your Jupyter Notebook environment. This Binder includes the following:



* LDA Topic Modeling Playground Jupyter Notebook
* Requirements.txt file to set up the environment
* Sample data to run in the notebook

The contents are grouped into five parts:



* Data preparation (Steps 1 - 3)
* Model training (Step 4)
* Model evaluation (Steps 5 - 7)
* Visualization of results (Step 8)
* Model improvement (Step 9)

Binder allows you to launch the notebook in an executable environment right away. After you launch the binder notebook, run the code in each cell and see the results in an interactive way. To close the notebook, you need to shut down the kernel. Closing a notebook browser tab is not enough to end the kernel. For more information about using Jupyter Notebook, check out [this page](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html).
